Answers to Q1-Q4:
-------------------------------
Q1. Brady removed the "case_longiso_time_style:" line because it was an iden-
tical case. The first instance of the case would've fell through the the
repeated case so Brady was just cleaning up the code. It was necessarily re-
quired due to the fall through effect described above.


Q2. With the patched version of the coreutils-7.6, the only thing that changed
was that we made the date show the traditional Unix format. Traditional doesn't
necessarily mean better. Things to watch out for are any other commands which
might have relied on the date being shown in the old format rather than the
patched version. Also, users in a different locale may not recognize the months
spelled in English or maybe order their dates in a different way. 


Q3. When a file like /dev/null is passed to randline.py, an error is shown. It
says "IndexError: list index out of range". That's because the file that we
passed in as an argument was totally empty so when the script attempted to
index the contents, an exception was thrown.

Q4. When we ran the script using the python3 interpreter rather than python2,
there is an error. The error is caused by a difference in syntax interpretaion
between the two interpreters because the message shown is "SyntaxError: invalid
syntax".
