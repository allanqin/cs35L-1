Installing a small change to a big package
------------------------------------------
The first thing I did was to get Coreutils 7.6 which I downloarded from the
assignment webpage. I downloaded it to my Desktop directory. I then unzipped
it using 'tar xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz'. I then changed into the unzipped
directory. I created my own directory 'mybuild' and used the command
'./configure /u/cs/ugrad/stanway/Desktop/coreutils-7.6/mybuild' to run the 
script readying for installation. Then with 'make install' the software was
installed.

To reproduce the bug, I switched the bin in 'mybuild' and ran the old version
of the ls -l command using './ls -l bin/bash'. The date indeed came out in the
wrong format (2013-07-09).

To apply the patch, I switched back to the highest level in the coreutils-7.6
folder and then went into the src folder. Opening the 'ls.c' file with vim, I
went to the lines specified from the diff output in the patch page and deleted
and added in the appropriate lines.

Back at the top of the source tree, just typing in 'make', many of the things
that were executed the first time were not needed again since we only made
changes to the ls.c file.

I reinstalled the patched software and went back into /mybuild/bin. I tested
out the fixed date format and it worked (Jul  9  2013).
