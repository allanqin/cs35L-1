How to handle IO errors
	-do for each file?

newline check: ==DONE==
put all lines of a file into an array.
check if the array at the higest index is a newline
if not, add newline to the array

Spec:
Take an arbitrary number of input file arguments
	-how to append together? (look at piazza) ==DONE==

Append newline character to files if they don't  already end in one ==DONE==
	-only case to watch for is empty file?
	-if so, then check for case where list is len 0

-u --unique option: ==DONE==
remove duplicate lines before random selection
	-cast list to set and back to list

-w --without-replacement option ==DONE==
when choosing random lines, eliminate the possibility of repeats
Idea: maybe put used lines in a list and check if a line has been chosen?
Error if input file contains less lines than NUMLINES. Throw an exception

for both -u and -w ==DONE==
Error if argument of n is greater than num of unique lines
