Spell-checking Hawaiian
========================
First we were supposed to create a file words that was made of the sorted
the sorted contents of the file /usr/share/dict/words. using cat on words
showed that the contents were indeed alphabetically sorted.

Next, we were supposed to test what different terminal commands did. wget was
used to download the assignment webpage and the commands were used on this 
file. Here are the following commands and their effects on assign2.html:

cat assign2.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
This replaces all non-alphabetic characters in the file with a newline.

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-za-z' '[\n*]'
Similar in function to above except the extra -s flag squeezes together any 
consecutive non-alphabetic characters and replaces them all with a newline.

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
The output from the previous command is sorted alphabetically.

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
The same output from the previous command except there are no repeated words.
Only unique words are kept.

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
comm compares two sorted files. This command therefore compared the files 
assign2.html and words.txt and puts the results into three columns. The first
column shows lines unique to the sorted assign2.html file, column 2 shows lines
unique to words.txt, and column 3 shows words common to both.

cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
This is the same as the above command except that columns 2 and 3 aren't shown
so that the output is only the words unique to the sorted assign2.html file. 



After using my script to create a file called hwords with the sorted Hawaiian
words from the hwnwdseng.htm, I can modify the last shell command listed above
to implement a spell checker for Hawaiian of sorts.

The following command now counts the number words in file.txt that are mis-
pelled Hawaiian words. The script found 405 mispelled Hawaiian words.

cat file.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc

The following command finds the words in file.txt that are mispelled
English words. The script found 14 mispelled English words.

cat file.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr -[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
sort -u | comm -23 - words | wc

In order to find which words that were "mispelled" as English but not as
Hawaiian I redirected the English spell checker command into an msEN
file (replacing the pipe to wc). I then compared msEN to hwords using
'comm -12 msEN hwords' which would give words common to both files. None
were found.

In order to find which words that were "mispelled" as Hawaiian but not as
English I redirected the Hawaiian spell checker command into an msHA file
(replacing the pipe to wc). I then compared msHA to words using the command
'comm -12 msHA words' which would give words that were mispelled in Hawaiian
but not in English. Piping it into wc there were 391 instances. Some of these
are "transcript", "user", "following", and "however". This makes sense because
we'd expect that many of the English words don't exit in Hawaiian, explaining
the larger number of instances found.
