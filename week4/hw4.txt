hw4 log
============================================================
This homework was to test the patch that we made. I checked out a new branch
of v3.0 called quote and applied my quote-3.0-patch.txt using the patch
command. I then used emacs with C-x 4 a to update the ChangeLog for each of
the .c files that I modified. I then commited my changes using something like
'git commit --file=ChangeLog'. I used 'git log' afterwards to be sure it
worked and sure enough my changes were logged. 

Next, I made a patch that could be sent through email using git am. The patch
was created using 'git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted.patch.txt'. To
test if this patch would work without having to do manual changes afterwards,
I switched to a new branch of v3.0 called tmp. I tried the git am but I was
getting some errors telling my I needed to use git am --abort first. I
switched to a new branch of v3.0 and aborted git am first. Then I ran the
command 'git am < formatted.patch.txt' and the changes were applied. 

To verify that the change log worked, I used 'make distdir' and inseced he
newly created diffutils*/ChangeLog file and sure enough my changes were
logged.
