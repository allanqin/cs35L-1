lab4 log
==============================================================
The first thing I did was download the diffutils repository from the web.
This went by with no problems. I initialized the git and captured the log
and tags into two files git-log.txt and git-tag.txt.

Next, I went into the log and searched for the commit with 'maint: quote...'
and copied the hash code. I then copied the contents into a quote-patch.txt
file and then checked out v3.0 of diffutils in a different branch 'mybranch'.
A small problem I had here was I kept looking up the wrong hash codes to find
the patch.

I used 'patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt' to patch the software and then built it
by running ./bootstrap, ./configure, and then 'make'. I then checked the
error for myself by trying diff . - and diff --help. It looks like some
comments changed the ` to and '. We only want the patch to change this in
c-character strings.

To fix this, we can use emacs in diff mode to revert certain changes that were
made that we didn't want. Diff mode can be entered by using 'C-x v ='. Using
'C-x v u' I reverted all changes that were made to non .c files. Then I went
into each .c file individually and changed anything that was done to comments.
After this, I had to manually apply some of the patches in the .rej files by
hand.

After this, I had 6 .c files which were modified as said in the spec. I used
'git clean -n' along with 'git clean -f' to remove the untracked files.
Checking with 'git status' showed I only had the modified files leftover.

I then redirected 'git diff' into a quote-3.0-patch.txt and built the new
diffutils again. Changing into the src directory and checking 'diff . -' and
'./diff --help' it appeared that the problem was fixed.

To do the sanity test I copied an old version of the source code into a
directory called diffutils-3.0 and the new version of my source code into
diffutils-3.0-patch and ran my implementation of diff to compare the two and
directed the output into quote-3.0-test.txt. The files aren't identical but
that would be expected as we made some changes. The differences are innocuous.
They merely show that there are some differences resulting from the .c files
that we were modifying earlier and that some back ticks and single quotes were
different resulting from the patch.
