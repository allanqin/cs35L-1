================================================================
Change management / Git Part 2
================================================================
Some possible errors you're getting on the lab:
1) Detached Head
	-git checkout v3.0 -b branchname
2) help2man errors -> set PATH

LAB:
Before you patch:
Switch to v3.0 branch and recreate the error

To build:
./bootstrap
./configure
make

cd src
run `./diff --help` and find incorrect back ticks

run `./diff . -` and notice the backtick as well

-Leave backticks as backticks in comments
/*  `  */ 	is what a comment looks like
-In C-strings, change backticks to " ' " (cstrings in between quotes)

-Go through all c.rej files and find places where you must manually make changes to backticks
-For non .c files, revert ALL changes to modified files (find in git status)

-Open the .c files with emacs and go into C-x v = mode
-Go near the lines of the diff to change and use C-c C-a to revert the hunk

-C-x v u on diff.h (reverts changes in whole file)
-C-c C-c at a line in C-x v = mode will jump to that portion in the source code

-man git-diff will get the man pages for git diff

Homework:
git format-patch -[num] --stdout > name.txt
	-num is how many commits do you want for the patch (use 1)
	
emacs diff.c
	C-x 4a 
		* src/diff.c: Changed all backticks to single quotes
		
emacs cmp.c

		* src/cmp.c: Changed all backticks to single quotes
