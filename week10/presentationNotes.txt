Presentation notes:

spatial segregation - more segregates has a larger dilation index u since people collapse together for
work and the are far apart agian when they go home. characteristice of cities with a central'
business district. "monocentric"

Cities where residential areas are more mixed with business have a lower dilation index
"polycentric"


Coommon thread is that many people collapse together for work/school in the morning
but they disperse less coordinatedly at the end of the day

DENSITY ANALYSIS:
Use density of people to determine hotspots

High dilation constant indicates less mixed city
low means that residential and businesses are mixed

Intermediate: Spatial spread is pretty constant thourghout day
Segregated: more residential
High: Central business district


Hotspots:
Loubar method for d_max

permanent hotspots - "heart of city"
intermediate hotspots - half a day
intermittent - few hours per day
