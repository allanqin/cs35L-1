lab6 log
=========================================================
This lab involved setting up secure shells for other people to access. We
did this from two points of view: admin and client.

As admin:
We had to create an account for a user on our server. To do this, we did the
following steps:
1) ssh-keygen (make public and private RSA keys)
2) sudo useradd -d /home/susan -m susan
3) sudo passwd susan (create password for client)
4) cd /home/susan
5) sudo mkdir .ssh
6) sudo chown -R susan .ssh
7) sudo chmod 700 .ssh (give client full permission on own directory)

The client is now ready to ssh to our server if they have our IP address.


As client:
This part involved trying to ssh to another server. We did the following steps:

1) ssh-keygen (create public and private key)
2) ssh-copy-id -i is_rsa.pub stan1@<IPaddressofserver> (give server our public key)
	-can now ssh into server and login by typing in our password
3) ssh-add is_rsa (add our private key to the ssh agent so we don't need to use
   password to login)
4) ssh stan1@<IPaddressofserver> (didn't need password or passphrase to login now)
5) ssh -X stan1@<IPaddressofserver> (X-session forwarding for GUI elements to be
   displayed on our computer)
	-tested the X-session forwarding by trying programs like firefox, gedit,
	xterm. It worked and the GUI was shown in our terminal window.
