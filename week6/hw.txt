homework 6
===============================================================
1) Suppose the other teams had been observing all the bytes going across our
   network. The resulting network we created would still be secure if we were
   using ssh to connectbecause in between the computers all the messages and
   data that were being sent across were already encrypted first so any third
   parties would be seeing gibberish. 

   Now suppose that the other teams had tapped our keyboards and recorded our
   keystrokes. Our network could then be compromised because although ssh'ing
   would encrpyt any messages sent in between through the network, it does not
   protect the "ends" of the network where the user interfaces with the compu-
   ter. Any entered passwords/passphrases could be detected through the key-
   strokes.

   If we were booting off a USB our security could also be compromised since
   outsiders could have access to our private key and hence when they are 
   spying on the network lines, they could use it to decrypt any messages 
   being sent to us, especially if our key wasn't passphrase protected.

2) the gpg --verify can only the integrity of the document that was sent. It
   can't verify that it originated from a particular person. This is because
   as a receiver, there isn't really a good way to verify that the public key
   which you are using to verify the digital signature of a file belongs to the
   person that you want it to. For instance, If Alice is sending a file to Bob,
   Eve can just sign a document saying that she is Alice, intecercept Alice's
   message and send her own to Bob. If Bob uses Eve's public key to verify it,
   it will seem legitimate, although it is not Alice's sent file.

   The only way to really combat this problem is to have a trusted third party
   keep track of which people have which public key so that when you want to
   verify a digital signature, you use the public key in the third party's
   database. This is what some companies like VeriSign do. The downside is that
   one must ultimately place their trust in the third party to do their job
   correctly.
