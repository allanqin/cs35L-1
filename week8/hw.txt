homework 8
===============================================================================
The first part of the homework concerned connecting to an Amazon EC2 server.
To do this, I made a free account and then followed the listed instructions.
Then I did the following to reproduce the crash:

1) Setup and configure a new instance of EC2 and create a key pair.
2) chmod 400 35L.pem
3) ssh -i 35L.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-200-83-14.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
*in terminal on my own computer* 
4) scp -i 35L.pem -r sthttpd-2.26.4 ec2-user@ec2-54-200-83-14.us-west-2.comput \
e.amazonaws.com:~
5) scp -i 35L.pem crash.sh ec2-user@ec2-54-200-83-14.us-west-2.compute.amazon \
aws.com:~
*back in EC2 server*
5) *back in EC2* sudo su
6) yum install gcc
7) cd sthttpd-2.26.4/src
8) *manually apply patch in thttpd.c file*
9) cd ..
10) ./configure CFLAGS="-g"
11) make
*followed the same steps as in lab to crash the server*

Second we were supposed to rank how serious we thought different vulnerabilit-
ies were and why. They are ranked with 1-5 with 1 being the most serious:

1) VU#945216 - I ranked this as the most serious threat because it exploits a
 vulnerability in using ssh, which is a very commonly used application and
 allows an attacker to attack remotely from anywhere. Because this attack uses
 ssh, it also means that it is initiated by the attacker as opposed to waiting
 for a vicitm to fall into some trap, as long as the server is accepting req-
 uests. If the attack succeeds, the attacker also gets to inject arbitrary code
 with full admin privileges so they'd basically have control over everything
 on the server. Extremely dangerous.
 
2) VU#732479 - This exploit is dangerous because it seems like many people
 would be prone to it because it takes advantage of a flaw in different ver-
 sions of IE, which comes preinstalled on all Windows computers. That's a lot
 of potential victims. The victim doesn't need to install any extra software to
 be attacked. This attack has been found in the wild already as well. The wild
 exploit takes advantage of Adobe Flash which Windows 8 already comes installed
 with. This attack is dangerous in that a large segment of people are already
 readily able to be hurt by it. 
 
3) VU#248083 - This exploit is affects only certain D-Link routers so its tar-
 get audience isn't as widespread. However, to those with the router, the pro-
 blem is serious because it allows for any remote attacker to access a backdoor
 and gain access to the administrator web interface of the router. This could
 then affect anybody that utilizes that router. Anytime that a stranger gains
 administrator privileges, the problem should be fixed very promptly.

4) VU#122582 - This vulnerability was ranked lower because it affects only
 four versions of some Dell PowerConnect hardwares. The exploit appears to be
 harder to execute successfully as well as the webpage says it may take mult-
 iple requests to reset the switch. If the attack succeeds, it also leads main-
 ly to a crash and subsequent denial-of-service for users. While not pleasant,
 this isn't as bad as having a stranger take control of your computer.
 
5) VU#863369 - This is the lowest ranked because it sounds like it would take a
 lot to go correct for this exploit to work. First of all, this only concerns
 users of the Mozilla Thunderbird email client. Also, the vulnerability is only
 realized only when a message is forwarded or replied to in Thunderbird. The
 result could be that arbitrary script could exeute within Thunderbird which
 wouldn't have control over other things in the computer so the damage would be
 self-contained.
